        <h2>Muslim Decline after 1857</h2>
        <p>
            The failure of the War of Independence in 1857 left Indian Muslims politically
            and socially marginalized. Seen as principal instigators by the British,
            Muslims were excluded from government service and modern education.
            This marginalization became the impetus for intellectual and political
            reform movements aimed at ensuring Muslim survival in a colonial state.

        <h2>Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and the Aligarh Movement</h2>
        <p>
            Sir Syed Ahmad Khan advocated for pragmatic engagement with colonial
            authorities and modern education. His Aligarh Movement sought to
            empower Muslims intellectually and socially, emphasizing scientific
            education, loyalty to the British, and political participation as
            mechanisms for community uplift.

        <h2>Formation of the All-India Muslim League</h2>
        <p>
            Established in 1906, the Muslim League became the political voice of
            Muslims across India. The introduction of separate electorates in 1909
            institutionalized communal representation and underscored the emerging
            idea of Muslims as a distinct political entity.

        <h2>Lahore Resolution and Pakistan Movement</h2>
        <p>
            The political dissatisfaction of the 1930s, combined with the failure of
            Congress-Muslim cooperation, culminated in Allama Iqbal’s 1930 address
            and the Lahore Resolution of 1940. These events laid the conceptual
            groundwork for Pakistan as a separate homeland for Muslims, articulating
            territorial autonomy and self-governance.
