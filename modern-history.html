        <h2>Early State-Building Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Upon independence in 1947, Pakistan faced unprecedented challenges,
            including a massive refugee crisis, territorial disputes, economic scarcity,
            and institutional vacuum. The deaths of founding leaders Jinnah and Liaquat
            Ali Khan exacerbated political instability, allowing the military and
            bureaucracy to dominate governance in the absence of robust parliamentary
            structures.

        <h2>Military Intervention and the 1971 Crisis</h2>
        <p>
            The centralization of power under military rulers, particularly Ayub Khan,
            prioritized economic growth but failed to address political representation,
            especially for East Pakistan. The denial of electoral mandates and
            political rights ultimately led to the 1971 war and the secession of
            East Pakistan, highlighting structural weaknesses in federal governance.

        <h2>Constitutional Developments and Islamization</h2>
        <p>
            The 1973 Constitution established a parliamentary system and affirmed
            fundamental rights, yet repeated military interventions undermined its
            authority. General Zia-ul-Haq’s Islamization policies altered the legal
            and social fabric of Pakistan, embedding religious considerations into
            governance and judicial practices.

        <h2>Nuclearization, Democracy, and Contemporary Issues</h2>
        <p>
            The nuclear tests of 1998 positioned Pakistan strategically on the global
            stage. Since 2008, democratic governance has been maintained, but Pakistan
            continues to grapple with civil-military imbalance, economic challenges,
            and political polarization. Contemporary analysis must account for these
            recurring patterns and their implications for sustainable governance.
